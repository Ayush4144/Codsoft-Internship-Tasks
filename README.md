## 📌 Tasks  

### 🔢 Task 1: Number Guessing Game  
- The computer randomly generates a number, and the user has to guess it.  
- Provides hints whether the guess is too high or too low.  
- Shows the total number of attempts when guessed correctly.  

### 🧮 Task 2: Simple Calculator  
- A basic calculator built with C++.  
- Supports operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.  
- Uses switch-case statements for clean handling of operations.  

### ❌⭕ Task 3: Tic Tac Toe Game  
- A two-player console-based Tic Tac Toe game.  
- Displays the game board after each move.  
- Checks winning conditions and declares the result (Win / Draw).  

### 📝 Task 4: To-Do List  
- Console-based to-do list manager.  
- Allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.  
- Simple implementation using arrays/vectors.
